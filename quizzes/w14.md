# Quiz: Jay Chou's Concert Information System
You are going to build a small system for the concert information of Jay Chou with `struct`. The program schema is provided as follows:
```c
int main() {
    // Initialize the concert information
    Concert concerts[3] = {
        {"Taipei", {2024, 12, 8}, 2500, 8000, 10000},
        {"Shanghai", {2023, 10, 15}, 2200, 6000, 8000},
        {"Singapore", {2024, 10, 13}, 3000, 9000, 12000}
    };
}
```
This quiz asks you to write code to finish the following requirements:
1. Create a structure type named `Date` with `typedef` to store the year, month, and day.
2. Create a structure type named `Concert` with `typedef` to store the concert location, date, ticket price, and the number of tickets sold, and the total number of tickets.
3. Print the location and the date of each concert in the format of `yyyy/mm/dd`.
- Example output:
```
Taipei: 2024/12/8
Shanghai: 2023/10/15
Singapore: 2024/10/13
```

4. Write a function called `highest_ticket_price` to print the concert with the highest ticket price.
- Example output:
```
Singapore
```
5. Update the location of Taipei to Taipei Arena using a pointer and print the updated location. You can use strcpy or other methods you like.
- Example output:
```
Location: Taipei Arena
Date: 2024/12/8
Price: 2500
```
