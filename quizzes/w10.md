# Find Maximum and Minimum Values Along with Their Indexes
- You are provided with a one-dimensional integer array and a length ranging from 1 to 10. - Please write a C program that finds the maximum and minimum values along with their indexes in the array.
- Please note that if there are multiple maximum or minimum values, you should print all of their indexes.
- All values in the array range from -10 to 10.
## Expected output
### Example 1
- Input
```
6
3 -3 9 -3 4 9
```
- Output
```
Max value: 9, indexes: 2 5
Min value: -3, indexes: 1 3
```
### Example 2
- Input
```
5
3 3 3 1 0
```
- Output
```
Max value: 3, indexes: 0 1 2
Min value: 0, indexes: 4
```

## Requirements:
1. You must use pointer arithmetic to access array elements.
2. You should not use any built-in functions or libraries from C.
3. Array indexes should start from 0.
