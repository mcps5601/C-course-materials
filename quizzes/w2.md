# Week 2 Quiz

## Description
A-Ming's midterm exam scores are: Chinese 85 points, English 92 points, and Mathematics 100 points. The exam determines the grade by the weighted average value, and this exam focuses on language subjects. The weight of Chinese, English, and Mathematics is 2:2:1. Please help A-Ming write a program to print out his report card.

In the report card, the following items need to be listed:
1. The name and score of each subject
2. Total score
3. Average score, rounded to the second decimal place
4. Weighted average score, rounded to the second decimal place
5. Grade (A for average score 90-100, B for 80-89, C for 70-79, D for 60-69, F for less than 60)

## Rule
- The total score, average score, and weighted average score need to be calculated by the program, and cannot be hardcoded in the code.
