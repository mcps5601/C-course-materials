# W9 Quiz: Sorting Values Using Pointers

Please write a program for using pointers to sort four integer variables a, b, c, and d in ascending order.

Initial Values: Given the following values for four integer variables:
```c
int a = 99, b = 35, c = 34, d = 97;
```

## Requirements
1. Implement a function called `sorting` to take pointers as arguments and sort the values in ascending order. You can swap two pointers at each time. You can also sort all four values in one function call. The former is preferred and easier.
2. Value modifications must be done using pointers.
