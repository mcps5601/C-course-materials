# Task: Find the Longest Common Prefix
Write a C program to find the longest common prefix (LCP) for the given two strings (separated by a space). LCP is the longest substring that the two strings start with. If no such prefix exists, the program should output "No common prefix".

## Requirements:
1. Assume each string has a maximum length of 100 characters.
2. Compare the strings character by character to find the longest prefix they all share.
3. If no common prefix exists, display "No common prefix". Otherwise, display the found prefix.

## Example:
- Input
```
flower flow
```
- Output
```
flow
```
- Input
```
dog racecar
```
- Output
```
No common prefix
```
