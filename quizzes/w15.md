# Quiz: Merging of Two Linked Lists
In this quiz, you will practice working with linked lists and dynamic memory allocation. The program schema is provided as follows:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h> // For malloc()

struct node {
    int val;
    struct node *next;
};
typedef struct node Node;

// Function prototypes. You can modify them.
void combineList(Node *head1, Node *head2);
void printList(Node *head);

int main() {
    int arr1[] = {12, 43, 56, 34, 98};
    int arr2[] = {85, 97, 100};
    int size1 = sizeof(arr1) / sizeof(arr1[0]);
    int size2 = sizeof(arr2) / sizeof(arr2[0]);

    // Write code to:
    // 1. Create two linked lists from arr1 and arr2.
    // 2. Call combineList() to merge the second list into the first.
    // 3. Call printList() to print the combined list.
}
```
You have to write a program to fulfill the following requirements:
1. Create two linked lists to store the elements of arr1 and arr2. Please use malloc() to allocate memory for the nodes.
2. Write a function called combineList() to append arr2 to arr1.
3. Write a function called printList() to print the elements of the combined linked list.

## Expected Output
```
12 43 56 34 98 85 97 100
```
