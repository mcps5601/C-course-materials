# Task: Reverse a String

## Objective:
Write a program in C to reverse a given string. The program should take a string as input, reverse its contents, and then display the reversed string as output.

## Requirements:
1. Assume the string will not exceed 100 characters.
2. Implement the string reversal logic without using any built-in functions like strrev. Instead, use loops and basic string manipulation.
3. After reversing the string, print the reversed string.

## Example Input and Output:
- Input
```
hello
```
- Output
```
olleh
```
- Input
```
C programming
```
- Output
```
