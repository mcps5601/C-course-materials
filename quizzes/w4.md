# W4 Quiz: Upper Triangular Printer
You will be required to write a program that print stars (*) in an upper triangular pattern.
For example, if the input is 5, the output should be:
```
*****
 ****
  ***
   **
    *
```

Requirements:
- Use `scanf` to receive input (integer only).
- Use nested for-loops to print the stars.
- Variable names should be meaningful. (e.g., `num_rows`, `current_row`, etc.)
